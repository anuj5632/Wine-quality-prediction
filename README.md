#Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and alcohol concentration. The model helps wine producers and enthusiasts assess wine quality efficiently.

#Features
 Dataset: Uses a structured dataset with wine characteristics and quality scores.

#Preprocessing:

 Handles missing values and outliers.

 Normalizes numerical features for better model performance.

Modeling: Implements classification/regression models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks.

Evaluation: Measures performance using accuracy, RMSE, MAE, RÂ² score, and confusion matrix.

Deployment: Can be integrated into applications for real-time wine quality assessment.

#Result
The model provides reliable predictions based on wine attributes. Performance metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook.
